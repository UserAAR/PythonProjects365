# New Day, New Python Project

Welcome to the **New Day, New Python Project** repository! This repository showcases my commitment to improving my Python skills by creating one new Python project every day. Each project focuses on various aspects of Python development, ranging from automation to game development, and data manipulation.

## ðŸŒŸ About the Projects
Each day, I will tackle a new challenge and create a fully functional Python project. All projects are self-contained within their respective directories, complete with code and documentation.

### Project Categories
- **Games:** Fun projects like Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock Paper Scissors.
- **Web Scraping:** Projects involving scraping websites like Hacker News, Medium, and Wikipedia.
- **Utilities:** Useful tools like email automation, file splitting, and text-to-speech.
- **Security:** Projects like steganography and password displayer.
